Description
-----------
Versatile Lorem Ipsum Generator that inserts various types of blind text directly into websites or copies it to the clipboard.
Directly inserts blind text into text fields on websites or copies blind text to the clipboard for other use. Choose the type and amount of text in an interactive, visual way.

Inserts
* paragraphs of variable length
* titles
* specific or random dates
* mail addresses
* internet addresses

All functionality is also accessible from the context menu.

For text the extension generates random snippets of the famous "Lorem Ipsum" blind text. For mail and internet addresses you can configure your own dummy data to insert. For dates you can configure the date format and choose among special dates (yesterday, today, tomorrow) or let the extension pick a random date for you.

Are you a designer and want to check, how your design looks with data? Do you have to test websites and want to easily enter some test data? Then this extension is for you.

This extension is extremely lightweight. Neither does it include any external libraries nor does it access internet resources.
